All of this code used to be MIT-licensed by QuiteQuiet and William Granados.
However after adding features and modules like the gnome-calculator, and
pyimgur, this new project will now have to be sub-licensed under the GPLv3 to
stay compliant with terms of the licences present in these modules.

NB: Contributions that had been MIT-licensed by William Granados has now been
    reliscenced under the GPLv3. Also, code that was left nearly untouched
    from the original project has been properly accredited to QuiteQuiet.
